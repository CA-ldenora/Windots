# Windots
A collection of scripts and configuration, commonly reffered to as dotfiles, for Windows.

At this stage the repoisitory only contains configuration for PowerShell 7 and Windows Terminal. I plan to add more over time.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your home directory.
2. Run `Setup.ps1` from an PowerShell prompt. **Not Elevated**.
