# Windots
A collection of scripts and configuration, commonly reffered to as dotfiles, for Windows.

At this stage the repoisitory only contains configuration for PowerShell 7 and Windows Terminal. I plan to add more over time.

Admin rights are required when running the setup script to create the symbolic link to Profile.ps1. This allows any changes made to the Profile script to be immediately reflected without re-running the setup script.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your home directory.
2. Run `Setup.ps1` from an elevated PowerShell prompt.
